# QR_Scanner_Generator
This repositery is all about an android application which can be used for both generating ad scannig barcodes(1 dimensional and 2 dimensional).And not only that we can even download or save the generated OR code to our device as well. And when we try to scan a qr code that actually contains a URL to a website than this application automatically redirects you to the specified url which is encoded in barcode or Qr code in your favourite browser.
